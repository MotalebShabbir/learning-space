**NumPy & Pandas Basics (Just enough for AI Engineering)**
- [ ] NumPy — arrays, reshape, dot product, cosine similarity calculation
- [ ] Pandas basics — DataFrame, read_csv, filtering, groupby (needed for RAG eval data analysis)

**Embeddings**
- [ ] What embeddings are — geometric intuition (cosine similarity)

- [ ] Paid APIs: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`, Voyage AI — when worth it
- [ ] Reranker models (Cohere, BGE) — retrieval + reranking > retrieval alone
- [ ] Vector databases: pgvector (PostgreSQL), Chroma (local)
- [ ] Hybrid search — BM25 keyword + vector similarity + RRF
- [ ] Metadata filtering and structured retrieval
- [ ] **Project:** Semantic document search engine — fully local, no API key

<details>
<summary>Steps 9–10 · RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</summary>

<br>

> RAG is how you give an LLM access to your data without fine-tuning.

**Architecture & Chunking**

- [ ] State machines and workflow graphs
- [ ] Human-in-the-loop checkpoints — pause and wait for approval

**Agent Patterns**
- [ ] ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) — the core loop
- [ ] Plan-Execute — plan first, then execute
- [ ] Reflexion — reflect on failure, retry
- [ ] Single-agent vs multi-agent orchestration

<details>
<summary>Step 13 · Fine-Tuning Awareness (Understand, don't do)</summary>

<br>

> You won't fine-tune models, but you must be able to explain to employers/clients when it's needed and when it's not.

- [ ] Fine-tuning vs RAG vs Prompt Engineering — when to use which (decision framework)
- [ ] LoRA / QLoRA — what it is, why it's efficient, GPU requirements (concept only)
- [ ] OpenAI fine-tuning API — how it works (overview, no hands-on)
- [ ] When NOT to fine-tune — most problems are solvable with better prompts + RAG
