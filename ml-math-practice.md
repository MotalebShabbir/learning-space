# ML Math Roadmap — 15 Minutes Per Session

> **Goal:** Build ML math foundations gradually alongside backend learning.
> **Rule:** Every day or 3 days a step — just 15 minutes. No pressure.
> **Resources:** 3Blue1Brown (YouTube), Khan Academy, StatQuest

## Phase 1 — Algebra Refresh (Step 1–2)
> Fix the foundation. Start here if math feels rusty.

- [ ] What are functions — understanding input/output
- [ ] Exponents and their rules (e.g. a² × a³ = a⁵)
- [ ] What is a logarithm and why it matters in ML
- [ ] Difference between log(x) and ln(x)
- [ ] Understanding summation notation (Σ)
- [ ] Reading graphs — slope and intercept

---

## Phase 2 — Linear Algebra (Step 3–7)
> The most important chapter in ML. Learn slowly, understand visually.
> Resource: **3Blue1Brown — "Essence of Linear Algebra"** playlist
> 
> 💡 **Hands-on:** From Phase 2, install NumPy (`pip install numpy`). After learning each concept, verify it using NumPy. This will also be useful in AI Engineering.

- [ ] What is a vector — understanding it simply
- [ ] Vector addition and scalar multiplication
- [ ] What is a dot product and how to calculate it
- [ ] What is a matrix — rows and columns
- [ ] Matrix addition and scalar multiplication
- [ ] Matrix multiplication (understand *why* it works this way)
- [ ] What is a transpose (Aᵀ)
- [ ] Identity matrix
- [ ] Concept of linear transformation
- [ ] Cosine Similarity — understanding vector similarity (crucial for Embeddings/LLMs)
- [ ] Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors — concept only (not computation)
- [ ] 💻 Try it with NumPy: create a vector, calculate dot product, calculate cosine similarity

## Phase 3 — Calculus (Step 8–12)
> Needed to understand gradient descent.
> Resource: **Khan Academy — Calculus**, **3Blue1Brown — "Essence of Calculus"**

- [ ] What is a derivative — understanding rate of change
- [ ] What a derivative looks like on a graph
- [ ] Basic derivative rules (power rule, constant rule)
- [ ] Chain rule — why it is the most important rule in ML
- [ ] What is a partial derivative
- [ ] What is a gradient — combination of partial derivatives
- [ ] Which direction a gradient points and why

## Phase 4 — Probability, Statistics & Information Theory (Step 13–20)
> The core engine of AI. If you don't understand probability, AI remains a black box.
> Resource: **StatQuest with Josh Starmer** (YouTube), **Khan Academy**

**1. Descriptive Statistics**
- [ ] Mean, Median, Mode — when to use which
- [ ] Variance and Standard Deviation
- [ ] What is overfitting — in statistical terms

**2. Probability Foundations**
- [ ] Basic rules and axioms of probability
- [ ] Expectation (Expected Value) and Variance — mathematical definitions
- [ ] Joint, Marginal, and Conditional Probability — deeply
- [ ] Bayes Theorem — actual calculation and application

**3. Probability Distributions**
- [ ] Normal (Gaussian) Distribution (Bell curve)
- [ ] Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions
- [ ] Categorical Distribution
- [ ] Softmax as a probability distribution over classes

**4. Advanced Statistics & Estimation**
- [ ] Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) — how models actually learn
- [ ] Maximum a Posteriori (MAP)
- [ ] Correlation vs Causation
- [ ] Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

**5. Information Theory**
- [ ] Entropy — measuring uncertainty
- [ ] Cross-Entropy Loss — comparing two distributions
- [ ] KL Divergence — distance between distributions

**6. Advanced Concepts**
- [ ] Markov Chains — foundation for Sequence Models and Reinforcement Learning

## Phase 5 — ML Math Connection (Step 21–24)
> See where everything you learned actually appears in applied ML.

- [ ] What is a loss function — MSE vs Cross-Entropy with math
- [ ] How Gradient Descent works
- [ ] Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam optimizer basics
- [ ] Math behind Backpropagation — chain rule in action
- [ ] Sigmoid function and Logistic Regression
- [ ] How Softmax + Cross-Entropy work together in Classification
- [ ] Manually trace the math of a simple neural network
- [ ] 💻 Verify with Scikit-learn: use LinearRegression, LogisticRegression to see how math translates into code

> Year 1 is about Backend — that is the main job.
> These 15 minutes are just slowly building the foundation.
